These are the instructions to run the PDF uncertainties in a very simple 
way, although not very efficient, using StNtuples and PDFTOOLS.

All the credit to the simplify running must go to Alon Attal, although
the current version, for 6.1.4 was done for Eunsin Lee.

These instructions are good as of today, October 15, 2008.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Setup of the directories and files (suggested strategy):

   The main directory to run is the StNtuple directory, that is used for running
   the code:

   In that directory:
                mkdir pfdtools
              
   and copy in the created directory the following files:

                TPDFReweight.cc
                TPDFReweight.hh

                pdf_syst.C
                pdf_syst.csh

                libpdftools.so

    and the directory

                tables/


Edit the file pdf_syst.C to set the proper configuration and ntuple files

The job must be run using two StNtuples: The first one contains the events of the sample
(that is indicated in line 14) and the second contains the events that pass the 
selection cuts (these are a subsample the previous one).

Running the code

         pdftools/pdf_syst.csh

One should get the appropriate output containing the relative uncertainty
in the acceptance.
